# ToDoList-ReactApp
My 1st React App, making a simple To-Do List 

Just Created a Basic ToDo List, using React. 
made this Responsive and also made it look as much good as possible using CSS.

Also this App lacks a feacture of Scroll in the List, as it's storing data nowhere,
and would vanish after refresh so not of much use, but a project is still a project ..  ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¥³
