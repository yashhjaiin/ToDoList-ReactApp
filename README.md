# ToDoList-ReactApp

> **My 1st _React App_, making a simple _To-Do List_**

Just Created a Basic ToDo List, using React. 
made this Responsive and also made it look as much good as possible using CSS. 

~~Also this App lacks a feacture of Scroll in the List~~

* **Added the Scroll Feature**
* **Added Marking Check âœ… when Task Done**

MoreOver Made Some UserInterFace Changes that one would Like.

However it goes, A project is still a project ..  ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¥³
